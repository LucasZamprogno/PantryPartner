# PantryPartner
This is a full-stack CRUD app that I built mainly as a platform for learning some tech. The idea is to have some central system for managing household food items.
Oftehn I would have the experience of "I don't know what to make from what I have", as well as forgetting what staples I like to have stocked if I haven't used them in a while.
This system stores ingredients and recipes.
Recipes can be suggested based on what is closest to having all its ingredients in stock, and the shopping list will show you all your staples that need restocking.

Really though, this was a basis to learn new tech. I had interacted with MongoDB before but never really used it or set it up directly. 
Honestly the data here is more suited to a relational database but this is what I wanted to learn.
I also was looking to learn React due to its popularity (which I now understand, very cool).
Then as a meta goal, I just wanted to go through the "fun" of doing initial setup and configuration of TypeScript, Express, MongoDB, Webpack, React, and Bootstrap all getting them to all play together.
